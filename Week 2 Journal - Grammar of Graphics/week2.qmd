# Prompt

Read the following introductory material on the grammar of graphics. In your 1-2 page reflection (see rubric for grading criteria), consider the scope of the grammar of graphics compared to your experience with plotting libraries in R (such as base graphics and ggplot2), SAS, and python.

Then, consider the low-level concepts of marks and channels discussed in Ch. 5 of Visualization Analysis and Design. How do these connect in to your understanding of the grammar of graphics?

# Response

The grammar of graphics outlines a process for which visualizations are created.
